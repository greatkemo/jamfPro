The logo must be in PNG or SVG format, and its file size must not exceed 16 MB. The logo is downloaded and cached, and it will be redownloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.\n\nThe 'default_logo' is required and will be used when there's no background image. If 'light_logo' is provided, it will be used when the user's new tab page has a background image. We recommend a horizontal logo with a transparent background that is left-aligned and vertically centered. The logo should have a minimum height of 32 pixels and an aspect ratio from 1:1 to 4:1. The 'default_logo' should have proper contrast against a white/black background while the 'light_logo' should have proper contrast against a background image.\n\nIf you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads and shows the specified logo(s) on the new tab page. Users can't override or hide the logo(s).\n\nIf you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will show no company logo or a Microsoft logo on the new tab page.\n\nFor help with determining the SHA-256 hash, see https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash.",

Each item in the list must contain both devices and urls in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.\n\nThe USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (\"requesting URL\") and the URL of the top-level frame site (\"embedding URL\") to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the \"urls\" field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in \"urls\" must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.\n\nIf this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the \"DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting\" policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.\n\nURL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via \"WebUsbBlockedForUrls\". If there is a clash, this policy will take precedence over \"WebUsbBlockedForUrls\" and \"WebUsbAskForUrls\".",
