(or just super) is an open source script that provides administrators with a comprehensive workflow to encourage and enforce macOS software updates for both Intel and Apple silicon Mac computers. Deployed using a single script, super creates a background agent (aka LaunchDaemon) that ensures software updates are applied with the least user interference possible. Further, super can also enforce software updates with options for customizable deferrals and deadlines. In other words, super makes the macOS update experience better for both users and administrators.",
